    "description": "The IC2 Group Exercise Bike from Life Fitness is built with solid steel for strength and stability, and finished with a sleek Matte Slate colour. Its parallel frame features a 173mm Q-Factor for a real road bike feel, while full frame shrouds and guards, aluminium pin-to-lock posts and sliders, and standard bras are also incorporated into the design. The IC2 is complete with four levelling feet and two transport wheels to assist with positioning and transportation. The Poly-V Belt Drivetrain transfers torque smoothly and quietly (and requires less maintenance too), while the 1:3 Drivetrain Gear Ratio offers a front-based, 15kg aluminium flywheel. Featuring an ANT+ Computer Console, the intuitive performance measurement effectively demonstrates intensity and effort, while showing cadence, heart rate and calorie expenditure. The power supply for this feature requires batteries. Paired with the dual-sided SPD and toe caged pedals is a multi-positioned soft PVC handlebar, offering vertical adjustments. You’ll also find a unisex padded sport saddle which enables vertical and horizontal adjustments. All adjustments can be made via the dials and levers. Meanwhile, there is a single water bottle holder and a push emergency stop button situated in front of the saddle for safety."

Plus, you get a pair of 3lb dumbbells included with your studio cycle so you can keep your arms and shoulders as strong as your legs. Other features include an autobreeze workout fan, Bluetooth Smart (BLE) HR Receiver, water bottle holder and non-slip multi-position handlebar. *30-Day iFIT Trial Included.

A knurled bar provides a secure grip throughout your workout, with red quick-lock collars keeping your weight plates safely on the bar. Simply hook the bar onto one of 12 positions to safely rack your weights. Safety spotters and j-hooks, with a textured rubber surface, are also included for when you want to use a traditional barbell safely. Plus, you can incorporate pullups and dips into your routine thanks to the integrated chinning bar and dip handles. Resistance band attachment points are there for when you want to make your squats more challenging, and a landmine attachment is also included for specific free weight exercises. For suspension training fanatics, there is a secure fixing at the top of the frame to attach your system to, making the Smith Half Rack the perfect platform for your favourite bodyweight movements. As if that wasn’t enough, four weight plate horns and a barbell holder are built-in to help keep your workout area organised and safe. Please note the Smith Half Rack is compatible with Olympic weight plates only. Pictured with 2x Heavy Duty Rubber Mats (BPMAGMAT) - sold separately."

    "description": "The PowerLine Smith Machine is a true powerhouse that is often imitated but never duplicated. It's a sophisticated combination of free weight power and resistance coupled with the safety and control of a machine. It uses four 2' x2' 12 gauge steel pillars to support and guide the patented Super-Glide carriage during your most vigorous sets. PowerLine has taken the best equipment out of the health club and engineered it to their own uncompromising standards, and best of all, we made it affordable! * Weight plates and collars optional * 14 lockout positions and adjustable safeties assure the lifter ultimate safety while striving for greater muscle gains. * Bar is 1' Dia. Pictured with Optional Olympic Adapter Sleeves #OAS14 Key Features: * Extra long twin carriages have long-life patented Super-Glide nylon bushings for frictionless movement and performance over 2'square, high polished chrome guide bars. * The ladder-type mainframe features full length, heavy-duty 12 gauge square pillars with 14 crossmember Lock-Out Points providing a solid foundation for the Safety Spotter Catches during the heaviest routines. * Another high-tech feature standard on the PowerLine Smith Machine is the dual-lock Safety Spotter Catch System. It prevents the bar from pinning the user in a max-out situation by simply turning the pivot sleeve only 15°. * Deeply knurled single pivot sleeve with positive glide roll radius was created to transfer lifting movements smoothly to the Safety Spotter Catches. Deemed a sophisticated dual-safety anti-slip lockout system, it operates independently from the main cross bar and simply locks in place with a quick turn of the wrists. * Heavy-duty Adjustable Safeties equip you for the unexpected. Jumbo pop pins are quickly and easily adjusted to help you come to a safer, predetermined stop with greater straight-line stability."

    "description": "Part of the heavy-duty Select series, the Hammer Strength Select SE Back Extension offers the comfort and simplicity ideal for novice weight trainers whilst its durability makes it tough enough for the seasoned campaigner. Boasting sturdy steel tubing, precision welds and internally lubricated cables, it delivers exceptional precision for maximised weight training. The frame is constructed of 11-gauge steel with an electrostatic powder coat finish to ensure maximum protection. Solid rubber feet prevent slipping while the U.S. Military standard cables come with lubricated, nylon coating. Stitching on the cushioning eliminates folds in the material for ultimate robustness and radius on edge moulding ensures extra comfort. The 138kg/295lb weight stack featuring solid steel plates offers plenty of resistance, which is easily tweaked via the conveniently placed incremental weight system. For safety, the 7/1' (11mm) diameter weight selector pin magnetically locks in place and is connected to the stack to prevent loss while the top weight plate is fitted with self-lubricating bushings. Five starting positions and two non-slip foot positions cater to different users while the lumbar pad helps you find the correct position with ease. A joy to train on, streamlined adjustments keep training simple so you can train alone without a spotter. Choose from a wide range of frame and upholstery colours for a custom model."

    "description": "The entry-level model in the WaterRower® range, the WaterRower® A1 rowing machine is lightweight and portable, originally designed for use in indoor rowing group classes. The A1 is handcrafted, combining the stylish aesthetic of a hybrid solid oak and aluminium frame with commercial-grade durability. It can even be stored vertically when not in use – three A1s stood together only take up the same amount of floor space as one standard indoor bike. Fitted with a WaterFlywheel, the A1 is unique in its replication of on-water rowing. Unlike traditional air or magnetic rowing machines, the WaterRower® A1 has a smooth stroke with no dead spots, placing minimal strain on joints and the lower back. The A1’s comfortable positioning and geometry make it easy to row with good form, using every large muscle group for an effective cardio workout. Equipped with the A1 Quick-Start LCD monitor, it’s easy to keep track of your performance as you row. The monitor displays your basic rowing metrics like distance, 500m split time and calories, and is embedded in the footboard for an uninterrupted stroke. Other integrated features include transport wheels for easy movement and adjustable footplates. WaterRower® is a registered trade mark of WaterRower (UK) Ltd and its affiliates."
