                The CLEAR FIT company was organized to create and implement high-quality and
                reliable sports equipment for home and light commercial use. Shortage of quality
                simulators on average price segment led to an unmotivated increase in prices for
                reliable equipment, creating an additional segment of "semi-commercial" simulators,
                which brought their cost closer to professional equipment. A filling the middle
                price segment was formed from the growth in the number of brands and manufacturers
                of inexpensive simulators with low technical characteristics, by increasing the
                number of additional options. The main criteria for the release of products with the
                CLEAR FIT brand are: high quality, reasonable price and comfort of training.
                Implement this a difficult task was allowed by the tandem of European developments
                and placement main production in Taiwan. Narrow specialization in cardio equipment
                for the home allows you to maintain high quality control at all levels production.
